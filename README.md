# Simple MVC

## Description

This repository is a simple PHP MVC structure from scratch.

It uses some cool vendors/libraries such as Twig and Grumphp.
For this one, just a simple example where users can choose one of their databases and see tables in it.

It serves as a basis for an application that was developpped in order to help people from the 14th century to avoid the great plague.
This application, called "Plague Off", lets the users run a vocal message that tells someone that is too close to them to back the f*** off.
The vocal message can have 3 different levels of rudeness.

This has been developped in less than 36 hours and presented by Axel Hamilcaro, Morgane Grenes, LÃ©o Brossillon, Celia Boisseau, Ricardo Da Silva Pereira, and Lucy Merlier as their project for the first "Hackathon" organised by the Wild Code School during the september 2020 session.

"Plague Off" uses some cool APIs as FOAAS or complimentr.

## Steps

1. Clone the repo from Github.
2. Run `composer install`.
3. Create *config/db.php* from *config/db.php.dist* file and add your DB parameters. Don't delete the *.dist* file, it must be kept.
```php
define('APP_DB_HOST', 'your_db_host');
define('APP_DB_NAME', 'your_db_name');
define('APP_DB_USER', 'your_db_user_wich_is_not_root');
define('APP_DB_PWD', 'your_db_password');
```
4. Run the internal PHP webserver with `php -S localhost:8000 -t public/`. The option `-t` with `public` as parameter means your localhost will target the `/public` folder.
5. Go to `localhost:8000` with your favorite browser.
6. Tell people to back off.

### Windows Users

If you develop on Windows, you should edit you git configuration to change your end of line rules with this command :

`git config --global core.autocrlf true`
